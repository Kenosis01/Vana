## Difference between Roo Code and Cline

We're doing our best to combine the best of both worlds. Vana combines all features of Cline, Roo, and adds a few of our own additions. It has the best features of both, and we're working on making it even better!

No need to fiddle with API keys, Vana ships with the latest AI models plugged in, including Claude 4 Sonnet and Opus and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Vana is a direct fork from Roo Code, but also includes the following features from Cline (and more):

- MCP Server Marketplace: Easily find, and use MCP servers to extend the agent capabilities.
- System notifications: Get notified when the agent is done with a task.
- Easy model connection: with bigger free tier.
